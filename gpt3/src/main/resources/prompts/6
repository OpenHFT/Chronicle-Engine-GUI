"prompt": "How can you perform functional tests on a stateful service that uses DTOs?",
"answer": "You can use YAMLTester, which supports DTOs and simple state initialisation. To specify initial state for tests, you can send the service an 'initialisation' message before the core requests. Initialisation messages are specified in the file setup.yaml, which should be located in the same directory as the other files used for YAMLTester. To define test cases, you can use the in.yaml file, containing the input messages to test, and the expected output from these, from the out.yaml file. When the test is run, the log messages will display information to illustrate progress. If any of the test cases fail, an indication of where the difference occurred will be shown."
