"prompt": "What is the solution for separating success and error handling?",
"answer": "Define separate DTOs for errors and add explicit handling to the API."
 
"prompt": "Why is it desirable to completely separate error messages from non error messages?",
"answer": "For some classes of errors, it is desirable to completely separate error messages from non error messages that are generated by a service. This could be done either at the downstream service for convenience, or for design reasons, based on the nature of the error being represented."
 
"prompt": "What needs to be done to the output API when a separate message for errors is posted?",
"answer": "The output API must be altered to reflect this."
 
"prompt": "What is the DTO for the error message?",
"answer": "The DTO for the error message needs to be defined like all other DTOs."
 
"prompt": "What are the three pieces of information included in the DTO for the error message?",
"answer": "1. The account number for which the error occurred. 2. A String describing the error. 3. A priority, which is defined using a Chronicle Services enum type allowing LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH or UNKNOWN to be specified."
 
"prompt": "What needs to be done by any component that will receive messages from the service?",
"answer": "Any component that will receive messages from the service must provide a handler for the message."
 
"prompt": "What is the purpose of the downstream handler for AccountError message?",
"answer": "The downstream handler for AccountError message is to handle the error message."
 
"prompt": "What is the purpose of the Transaction service implementation with check for valid account number?",
"answer": "The purpose of the Transaction service implementation with check for valid account number is to generate and return the error message if the conditions for it are found."
 
"prompt": "What is the purpose of the single instance of the AccountError DTO that is maintained for each service instance?",
"answer": "The single instance of the AccountError DTO is maintained for each service instance to avoid contention for this object."
 
"prompt": "What happens if the lookup of the account in the map of known accounts fails?",
"answer": "If the lookup of the account in the map of known accounts fails, then the existing error DTO is cleared out, the details of the error are filled in, and the error message is posted to the output."
