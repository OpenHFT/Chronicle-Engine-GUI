"prompt": "How can you ignore certain events based on the contents of the contained DTO?",
"answer": "Use the method ignoreMethodBasedOnFirstArg() from the interface MethodFilterOnFirstArg<T>." 

"prompt": "What is the purpose of filtering requests being handled by a handler method?",
"answer": "To ignore the event. There are various reasons for this, perhaps you have multiple service instances running, and wish to partition the event handling across these instances based on some criterion." 

"prompt": "What API does Chronicle Services provide for implementing message filtering?",
"answer": "The API for the Transaction Service is modified to include the MethodFilterOnFirstArg<T> interface." 

"prompt": "What is the purpose of the MethodFilterOnFirstArg<T> interface?",
"answer": "To provide the filtering behaviour, the service implementation is required to implement the interface MethodFilterOnFirstArg<T>, where T is the type of the value that is being checked." 

"prompt": "What should the method supplied to perform the filtering do?",
"answer": "The method should examine the value of the firstArg parameter, and return true if the message is to be ignored, false if the message is to be processed." 

"prompt": "What is the purpose of the service configuration in this example?",
"answer": "Each instance of the service should handle requests for account numbers in a specific range. The bounds of the range for each service are supplied as configuration parameters." 

"prompt": "How is the configuration information processed during service initialization?",
"answer": "The configuration information is read and processed during service initialisation using the serviceContext() method." 

"prompt": "What is the purpose of the accounts() method in the service implementation?",
"answer": "To set up some initial accounts, for demo purposes." 

"prompt": "What is the purpose of the acceptFrom and acceptTo variables in the service implementation?",
"answer": "To extract the range of account numbers to be handled by this service instance." 

"prompt": "What is the purpose of the runDemo.sh script?",
"answer": "To run the example for this recipe." 

"prompt": "What is the purpose of the out.transaction() method in the example?",
"answer": "To post transactions for the service." 

"prompt": "What is the purpose of the downstream service in this example?",
"answer": "To read the messages and logs them."
