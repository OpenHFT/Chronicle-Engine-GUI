"prompt": "How can you test that a Chronicle Service generates the correct output messages when input messages are passed to it?",
"answer": "You can use the Chronicle Services YAMLTester framework which supports interface-based testing of Chronicle Services by creating a harness that passes messages to an instance of the service, and intercepting the corresponding output to verify that it is correct in each case. The input message and expected output for that message are written in YAML files in the directory src/test/resources/test/sum. The test is run using JUnit, and the test harness in YamlTester.testMessages will create an instance of the service, inject an instance of the output interface, pass the messages in the in.yaml file that is found in the specified directory, capture the output messages, and compare them with the expected output from the out.yaml file. Tests may be run from the command line using Maven or from the IDE."
