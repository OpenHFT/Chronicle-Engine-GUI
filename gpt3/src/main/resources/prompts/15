"prompt": "How can you make the configuration file more general to allow for different values for properties to be supplied when the service is run?",
"answer": "You can use system properties and reference them from within the configuration file. The services.yaml file syntax allows for the use of system property values, which are then substituted when the application is run. To parameterize the location of the backing files for the Queues used to communicate between services, you can introduce a system property into the configuration file and use the term ${queue.basedir} to substitute it when the file is read."
