"answer":"The PollingUpdateSource interface should be implemented to use Polling Updates events."

"prompt":"What methods should be overridden when implementing the PollingUpdateSource interface?",
"answer":"The methods that should be overridden when implementing the PollingUpdateSource interface are publishUpdateOnIdle() and pollingUpdate(long)."

"answer":"pollingUpdate(long) will continue to be invoked every time the service event loop runs as long as publisherUpdateOnIdle() returns true."

"prompt":"What should be done to run pollingUpdate(long) only once every time publishUpdateOnIdle() returns true?",
"answer":"To run pollingUpdate(long) only once every time publishUpdateOnIdle() returns true, make publishUpdateOnIdle() returns false before one run of the pollingUpdate(long) method finishes e.g. this can be done somewhere inside the pollingUpdate(long) method."

"prompt":"What is the signature of the pollingUpdate(long) method?",
"answer":"The signature of the pollingUpdate(long) method is void pollingUpdate(long currentTime)."
