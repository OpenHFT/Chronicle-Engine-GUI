5.1 Using an Alternative Configuration File
Problem
You want to use an application configuration file named other than services.yaml.
Solution
Pass the name of the configuration file to the call to ThreadRunner.runAll() method.
Discussion
The use of the name services.yaml is a convention and not explicitly required. If you want to maintain different 
configurations of the same application, you can do this easily by using separate configuration files.
The method that is normally used to start an application from the main driver class is ThreadRunner.runAll(), 
which accepts a pathname to a configuration file as a parameter:

Simply changing this parameter will allow a different configuration file to be used.
