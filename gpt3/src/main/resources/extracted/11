3.4 Testing Separate Error Handling
Problem
You want to test a service that uses a separate error message with its own DTO.
Solution
Use the YAMLTester to construct test scenarios that should generate posting of the specific error messages.
Discussion

this in the output. For the test setup in setup.yaml:
Listing 41. Setup for YAML test
 
The test input:
Listing 42. Input messages for test
