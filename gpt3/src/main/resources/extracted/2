1.2 Defining a Chronicle Service
Problem
You want to define a Chronicle Service.
Solution
Define the service's public input and output interface, then provide an implementation class.
Discussion
A Chronicle Service accepts input messages/events from one or more sources, and outputs messages/events to one 
sink. To define a service, you need to specify the message types expected as input and those generated as output as 
Java interface types. Let's consider a simple example, where a service performs a simple addition of two numbers and 
posts the result:
 
The service has one input and one output, these are defined as Java interfaces:
Listing 3. Service Input Interface
 
Listing 4. Service Output Interface
 
1.2 Defining a Chronicle Service
The service implementation is defined in the following class:
Listing 5. Service Implementation Class
 
The implementation class implements the SumServiceIn interface, indicating that it will accept messages/events 
defined in this interface. A reference is maintained to an instance of the output interface, SumServiceOut, 
providing a channel to output messages from the service. This reference is injected into the implementation class 
during construction.
The project can be laid out following standard rule for a Maven project, shown here being managed using IntelliJ Idea:
